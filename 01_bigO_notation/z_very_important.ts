/*

Time Complexity -> Its the time required by computer to run an algorithm.
O(n) - Its the worst case time complexity notation, and it is widely used than other types due to its power.

1. Arithmetic operations are constant. ie, O(1)
2. Variable assignment is constant. ie, O(1)
3. Accessing element of an array with index or of an object with key. Time complexity is constant O(1)
4. In a loop - Time complexity depends on length of loop. ie, it may be O(n), O(n^2), or O(n^3), etc.

... and so on.
